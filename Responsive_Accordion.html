            In May 1980, Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. Boats were headed for Cuba. It soon became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives, but the dregs of his jails. Of the 125,000 refugees that landed in Florida an estimated 25,000 had criminal records.

      I don't care if it takes from now till the end of Shrimpfest. Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! Mr. Zuckerkorn, you've been warned about touching. You said spanking. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Turn this skiff around! Everybody dance NOW.

              If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I will be a bigger and hairier mole than the one on your inner left thigh! I think the only time you cooked for us was the morning Rosa's mom died. You gave us cereal in an ashtray.
